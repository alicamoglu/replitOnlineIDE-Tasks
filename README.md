### Finish the method called `reverse()` that will take a `String` `input` argument and returns a reversed version of `input`. Reverse the String meaning the characters in the end will be changed to the characters in the beginning and vice versa. The `reverse()` method is already called in the main method with an argument.

#### This is a `return` method with a `String` parameter

Main topics: methods, Scanner, loops, String, concatenation

```
  reverse("java")

output: 
  avaj
```
Example:
```
  reverse("Hello")

output: 
  olleH
