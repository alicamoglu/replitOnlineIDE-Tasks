### Use `String methods` to check if the given `word` contains the text `java`, but not anywhere in the String. The `java` text must be in either position 0 or position 1 of the String. If the text `java` appears in any other position it is not valid and is not considered to be found in the String. Output a `boolean value, true or false`.

#### Note: You won't be able to just use contains method
